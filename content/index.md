This is the wiki of [doug](mailto:contact@16090000.xyz) from somewhere dimensionless - a [nullniverse](https://blog.16090000.xyz) of sorts. There's not many things interesting to know about him , hence, this Wiki and its Humble Writer pretends to jot down only the literal impersonal content.

This Wiki pays tribute to mandarin Chinese for it's [orthographic efficiency](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/19388079909558298)[ [2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2096531120930485)] even though its Writer is a suburban Latin living in South America. He's somewhat used to [[mandarin learning]] - and if you are allergic somehow to East Asian spice stop reading, now!

Besides [[computers, technologies and rogue engineering]] his interests goes towards [[scientific musings]], [[reading books]] and random speculations [[verging in the edge of the uncanny]].

This Wiki is live, meaning that it keeps updating and iterating as new subjects are offloaded from the Maintainer's [holonomic brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomic_brain_theory).
